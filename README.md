## Overview
Authorization / Authorisation / Authz - "the process of verifying that a requested action or service is approved for a specific entity" [[NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/authorization)]
- [OWASP Authorization Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.html)
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization)

## Authentication vs. Authorization
- Authentication - Determines *who* someone or something is (identity)
- Authorization - Determines *what* someone or something can do in a system (permissions)
- [Understanding Authentication, Authorization, and Encryption](https://www.bu.edu/tech/about/security-resources/bestpractice/auth/)

## Access Control Models
- [Role Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)
- [Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control)
- [Graph Based Access Control (GBAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph-based_access_control)
- Relationship Based Access Control (ReBAC)
- [Organization Based Access Control (OrBAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation-based_access_control)
- [Discretionary Access Control (DAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretionary_access_control)

## Security Concerns

## Best Practices
- [OWASP Recommendations](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.html#recommendations)
- *Enforce least privileges and deny by default* - Ensure that users and systems only have access to what they need and nothing else.
- *As fine-grained as possible* - Authorization checks should be as specific as possible. Ideally, this means the system has the ability to check access based on specific records and resources.
- *Implement once and reuse* - Keep authz logic in one place to ensure consistent checks and to prevent missed cases and potential security holes.
- *Maintain an audit log* - Keep an authorization log (allow/deny) to track access and conduct audits where necessary.
