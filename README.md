## Authentication vs. Authorization
- [Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication) - Determines *who* someone or something is (identity).
- [Authorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization) - Determines *what* someone or something can do in a system (privileges and permissions).

- [GBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph-based_access_control) - Graph based access control.
- [MAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control) - Mandatory access control.
- [OrBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation-based_access_control) - Organization based access control.
- [ReBAC](https://www.scaledaccess.com/whitepapers/the-developers-guide-to-relationship-based-access-control) - Relationship based access control.

## Best Practices
- [OWASP Authorization Cheat Sheet & Recommendations](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.html) - Authz overview and recommendations for best practices:
  - Enforce least privileges and deny by default - Ensure that users and systems only have access to what they need and nothing else.
  - As fine-grained as possible - Authorization checks should be as specific as possible. Ideally, this means the system has the ability to check access based on specific records and resources.
  - Implement once and reuse - Keep authz logic in one place to ensure consistent checks and to prevent missed cases and potential security holes.
  - Maintain an audit log - Keep an authorization log (allow/deny) to track access and conduct audits where necessary.
